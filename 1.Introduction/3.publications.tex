During this PhD, I have co-authored the following work,
most of which will be shown within this proposal:

\begin{itemize}

    \item {\bf A Simple and Effective Approach to Automatic
          Post-Editing with Transfer Learning}~\citep{Correia2019}.
          Described in Chapter \ref{chap:ape}, this paper was accepted as a
          poster at ACL 2019.
          
    \item {\bf Unbabel's Submission to the WMT2019 APE Shared Task:
          BERT-based Encoder-Decoder for Automatic
          Post-Editing}~\citep{lopes2019unbabels}. Not included within this
          proposal, this work describes an Automatic Post-Editing model
          that was submitted to the APE Shared Task at WMT2019. This model
          won the Shared Task, obtaining state-of-the-art results in APE at
          the time.
          
    \item {\bf Adaptively Sparse
          Transformers}~\citep{correia2019adaptively}. Described in Chapter
          \ref{chap:adaptsparse}, this paper was accepted for an oral
          presentation at EMNLP 2019.
          
    \item {\bf Efficient Marginalization of Discrete and Structured
          Latent Variables via Sparsity}~\citep{correia2020procneurips}.
          Described in Chapter \ref{chap:sparsemarg}, this work was
          accepted as a spotlight paper at NeurIPS 2020.
