\section{Contributions and Thesis Statement}
\label{sec:int_contributions}

In this thesis, we explore the possibilities
of interpretable structured latent variables
in NMT. We have the following goals:

\begin{itemize}
      \item Designing a NMT model capable of creating a
            draft translation of the final target sentence,
            that will be used as a template for the final translation.
      \item Disentangle the latent representation of the
            draft from the latent representation of the semantic meaning
            shared between the source and target sentence.
      \item Using monolingual data of the source and/or target language
            for semi-supervision of the model.
      \item Designing an efficient method for document-level or in-domain
            NMT that uses a latent summary to condense the overall document or domain
            into only the relevant sections for the current sentence.
\end{itemize}
