This thesis is based, in part, on the following publications:

\begin{sloppypar}
      \begin{itemize}

            \item {\bf A Simple and Effective Approach to Automatic
                  Post-Editing with Transfer Learning}~\citep{Correia2019}.
                  Described in \chapref{chap:ape}, this paper was accepted as a
                  poster at ACL 2019.
                  
            \item {\bf Unbabel's Submission to the WMT2019 APE Shared Task:
                  BERT-based Encoder-Decoder for Automatic
                  Post-Editing}~\citep{lopes2019unbabels}. Not included as a specific
                  chapter within this thesis, this work describes an Automatic
                  Post-Editing model that was submitted to the APE Shared Task at
                  WMT2019. This model won the Shared Task, obtaining state-of-the-art
                  in APE at the time.
                  
            \item {\bf Adaptively Sparse
                  Transformers}~\citep{correia2019adaptively}. Described in
                  \chapref{chap:adaptsparse}, this paper was accepted for an oral
                  presentation at EMNLP 2019.
                  
            \item {\bf Efficient Marginalization of Discrete and Structured
                  Latent Variables via Sparsity}~\citep{correia2020procneurips}.
                  Described in \chapref{chap:sparsemarg}, this work was
                  accepted as a spotlight paper at NeurIPS 2020.
