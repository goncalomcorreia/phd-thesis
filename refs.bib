I am curious how these types of embeddings perform on a real downstream task, not just word similarity. Also I wonder if the conclusions would be different for an agglutinative language with a worse oov problem.}

  note      = {Various NMT systems are trained with translation to, from, and between morphologically rich languages (but none that are agglutinative). Word representations output by encoders are used as input to non-linear classifiers for predicting POS and morphological tags. Models with CNNs over characters do better than word-level models. POS/morphology information mostly expressed at lower model layers. Classifier results are better when the target language is morphologically poor, although there is no significance test. Could it be that subword structure is more important if it needs to be translated into more independent words, as is the case when you translate to a morphologically-poor language? Or is it just that English is an easy target? The decoder does not learn morphologically-aware word representations (except for a little bit if there is no attention). Using character-based word reps does not help the decoder learn morphology. This paper is interesting, but does not give much of a baseline for how easy it is to get good morph/POS results.}

               problem. 
               It has recently been applied for cross-lingual transfer learning for paradigm
               completion---the task of producing inflected forms of lemmata---with
               sequence-to-sequence networks.
               However, it is still vague how the model transfers knowledge across languages,
               as well as if and which information is shared.
               To investigate this, we propose a set of data-dependent experiments using an
               existing 
               encoder-decoder recurrent neural network for the task. Our results show that 
               indeed the performance gains surpass a pure regularization effect and that
               knowledge about language and 
               morphology can be transferred.},

They claim this shows that word embedding graphs (a nearest neighbor graph for one language, compared to its translation in another language) are not isomorphic between languages, which seems pretty obvious and disappointing that the other work is based on the assumption that they are. Cheap supervision based on aligning identical word forms across languages helps some. I wonder what the upper bound is for aligning word embeddings -- would lemma embeddings do any better? What about aligning inflection embeddings?}

This algorithm is based on stochastic approximation and allows for efficient use of gradient information from the model joint density. We demonstrate these properties using illustrative examples as well as in challenging and diverse Bayesian inference   problems such as variable selection in logistic regression and fully   Bayesian inference over kernel hyperparameters in Gaussian process regression.}
