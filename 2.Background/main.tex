\noindent This chapter will discuss the foundations of our work and
remind the reader of crucial concepts needed to understand this
thesis. Foremost, we will present key machine learning concepts.
Then, we will discuss neural networks in the context of NLP,
particularly sequence modeling. Secondly, we will lay the foundations
for using unstructured and structured sparse projections into the
simplex. Finally, we will discuss critical
concepts regarding latent variable models, particularly with discrete
(unstructured and structured) latent assignments.
