\noindent This chapter will discuss the foundations of the work proposed in
this thesis. Foremost, we will present the background needed to
understand this work regarding neural networks, particularly in the
context of NLP. Secondly, we will lay the foundations for using
sparse probability distributions in the context of activation
functions of neural networks or discrete structured nodes of their
computation graph. Finally, we will discuss critical concepts
regarding latent variable models, particularly ones with discrete and
structured latent assignments.
