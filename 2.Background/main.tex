\noindent This chapter will discuss the foundations of our work and
remind the reader of crucial concepts needed to understand this
thesis. Foremost, we will present neural networks, particularly in
NLP and sequence modeling. Secondly, we will lay the foundations for
using sparse probability distributions in the context of activation
functions of neural networks or structured nodes of their computation
graph. Finally, we will discuss critical concepts regarding latent
variable models, particularly with discrete and structured latent
assignments.
